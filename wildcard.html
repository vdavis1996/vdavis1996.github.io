                <h3>About</h3>
                <h1>This site is for my character designs. It's where you
                    can get to know not only my characters, but myself. I plan to make comic books or
                    animated series someday and I would like to share
                    a "sneak peek" of who my characters are. It's no
                    secret that I'm a nerd, because of course I love reading
                    comic books, manga, and I grew of with cartoons and anime.
                    they fuel my imagination as well as life itself in a good way and in a tough way. 
                    Iv'e thought about how to share my art with others, but I want to share them with
                    the world. So, why not introduce folks my artisty by starting with my 
                    characters...which has been living rent free in my wild, imaginative head
                    forever, but I'm proud to say that each and everyone of them has something 
                    to offer, because they're all beautiful creations from inspirations.</h1>

                <h3>Statement</h3>
                <h1>I love art in a variety of forms, especially digital
                art; like animation.Or even comic book art. They allow me to escape and immerse myself into
                another world, relate to characters, love them, and give me a 
                place of belonging. Anyone who tells me that this isn't art, well
                maybe instead of thinking that only naked folks eating fruit is real art, they
                may want to crack open that fossilized mind of theirs and
                get that pretentious pole surgically removed from down under because
                art can be almost anything as expressive and meaningful, but also fun and
                creative; in other words, it ain't gotta be soul-sucking boring and dull.</h1>
